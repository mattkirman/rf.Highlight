 *
 * 
 * An implementation of the famous "Yellow Fade Technique" as a jQuery plugin.
 * 
 * This version is reliant on rgba support in the client's browser. While not
 * ideal, as this isn't supported in all browsers, I am not in any hurry to fix it.
 * 
 *
 * Usage: $('#element').highlight(options:Object);
 * 
 * Options:
 * 
 * color (array | default: [255, 255, 187])
 * The rgb color of the highlight. Yep, it doesn't actually have to be yellow.
 * 
 * duration (int | default: 400)
 * How long the fade lasts for.
 * 
 * wait (int | default: 3000)
 * The initial pause before the element starts to fade. During this time the element
 * will still be highlighted.
 * 
 * quality (int | default: 20)
 * How many steps do you want the fade to be rendered in. You shouldn't need to
 * change this as 20 is a reasonable amount.
 *

 * Tested in Firefox & Safari. Should work fine in IE 8.
